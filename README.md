# Lucky Meal

### This game may contain Gambling Themes.

Lucky Meal is a game prototype developed over one week, using Godot (version 4), following the theme "A midnight snack at a casino."

Every night, you, the player, desire a midnight snack, but an empty fridge and all the restaurants in town becoming casinos force you to play for your food.  

The game only contains slots and blackjack as games due to the time limitation, as well as a small variety of ingredients. It's also very simple in graphics.

## About the project

The game used Godot's GDScript.  

The original code might be cluttered and spaghetti-ish, but a few changes were made after the challenge for a better understanding. However, a few bits still might be ugly and open for changes. In any case, opening an issue is more than welcoming.

### About the ingredients

Ingredients (food) are hard-coded in the game. It could have become a resource type in the project and implemented around it, but it was made that way to save time.  

Even though the code had a little polishing for open-sourcing, the code still kept those hard-coded ingredients due to simplicity and linkage with the original code.
